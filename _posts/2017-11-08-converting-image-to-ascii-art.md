While browsing Stack Overflow, I generally browse one or two links from the sidebar "Hot Network Questions". It brings me to several interesting topics, not necessarily related to development. And this time, I found an interesting post: (how do ASCII art image conversion algorithms work?)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394882/how-do-ascii-art-image-conversion-algorithms-work].

ASCII art image conversion algorithm is really simple. We just have to convert every pixel of our picture into a grayscale value, and display a character related to this value. For instance, `@` is darker than `+`, which is also darker than `.`. So, let's try to implement such an algorithm in pure JavaScript.

## Uploading an Image into a Canvas

When working with pixels, we need a canvas.

## Turning an Image into Grayscale

## Mapping the Pixels to the GrayScale Values

## Final Demonstration
